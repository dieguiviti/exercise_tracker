# Exercise Tracker App

This app is fully deployed and available at https://mywodtracker.herokuapp.com

The workout logging MERN stack application deployed with heroku.

For Production, for uri and jwt keys, I recommend using dotenv (.env) instead of config.get() with default.json.

**In order to run this app, you will have to connect it to your own Database URI.**

To run.

0- Clone the app's repository.

1- cd into app's root directory and run 'npm install'

2- cd into client folder and run 'npm install'

3- cd back into app's root directory and run 'npm run development'

PD: You will likely have to install concurrently (app root folder "npm i concurrently"), and nodemon (sudo npm i -g nodemon)
